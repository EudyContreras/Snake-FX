Notes and Ideas about the Game

Bugs and Issues and Fixes{
  *There is an issue that may happen when a path creating attempt happens when the head of the snake is one cell or less less from the its body
  and the head of the snake is directly facing its body. This events makes it so no path is created since there is a neigbor check that makes the path
  unsafe thus makes the path creation in this particular scenario impossible. I have to re-implement some logic that produces a fix for this specific case.

  *There is a chance for there to to be array exceptions once a index is access

Multiplayer System Common{

-There could be buffs in the form of spawnable bugs or flowers. The bugs will have negative effects while the
 flowers may have benefits. The bugs will spawn in order in front of each player at a distance determined by the current
 speed of the player. The benefits will spawn randomly at a fair distance from both players.

AI Functions{
	Add a special bounding box to the mouth of the snake which checks for imminent collisions before fatal collisions happen
	If the head of the snake looses a path and intersects its body allow the snake to enter an evasive state in which
	checks are made to ensure that the snake does not make any collisions. make a collision based action dependant on range!
	The function will check its surroundings and make a brute decissions base on a small range of self awareness.
	"PSEUDO CODE"
		if collision: assess the neighbors of the current cell at a initial depth of 3. meaning the neighbors of the current
		cell and the neighbors of those neighbors and the neighbors of the last checked neighbors.
		asses the amount of neighbors for each available turn. If there was a biggest amount of neighbors
		produced by one of the checks perform the turn that produced those neighbors . If both turns produce
		the same amount of neighbors favor the turn that makes the snake closer to the closest border.


	Stall Mechanics:
		allow the snake zic zac in the following pattern.
			"PSEUDO CODE"
				make the snake turn to its right
				Once the snake meets an occupied cell


	Here is another one: Do not allow the AI to get out of the tail chasing state until a path to an objective is found!

	Implement a mechanic that allows the ai to assest paths while chasing tail. If a favorable path is found then pursuit th path
	otherwise keep chasing tail.

	If path to goal is safe : go for apple! Else check next apple until a safe path is found or all
	apples are checked. If no path to any apple is safe including the paths produced if teleportation is
	possible, Then find the farthest path to the tail and remain chasing the tail until a safe path to an
	objective becomes available. If no path to tail is found : Find a path which is farthest from the closest objective and
	if not possiblecstall until death using the following pattern!

	if moving left:
		move down until blocked then move left until blocked. move up until block: then move right once cell until blocked. Then down
		until block move on cell right
	if moving right:
	if moving up:
	if moving down:

	Do not let the snake commit to a path before the a check is made to see if the path is better than the current path.
