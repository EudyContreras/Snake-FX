Notes and Ideas about the Game

Bugs and Issues and Fixes{
  *There is an issue that may happen when a path creating attempt happens when the head of the snake is one cell or less less from the its body
  and the head of the snake is directly facing its body. This events makes it so no path is created since there is a neigbor check that makes the path
  unsafe thus makes the path creation in this particular scenario impossible. I have to re-implement some logic that produces a fix for this specific case.

  *There is a chance for there to to be array exceptions once a index is access

Multiplayer System Common{

-There could be buffs in the form of spawnable bugs or flowers. The bugs will have negative effects while the
 flowers may have benefits. The bugs will spawn in order in front of each player at a distance determined by the current
 speed of the player. The benefits will spawn randomly at a fair distance from both players.
