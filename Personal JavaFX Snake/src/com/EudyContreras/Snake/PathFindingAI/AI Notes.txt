Notes and Ideas about Artificial Intelligence!

	TODO: Future Implementations and Ideas.

		*Add strategic give up so that the the AI would stop pursuing and
		objective that is either out of reach or that the competitor will
		certainly get to first.

		*Add strategic speed boost: If competing for an objective make the
		ai use its energy levels intelligently so that it can be used under
		the right circumstances. Example: If going through an area which
		affects health. If a boost would allow it to reach objectives which
		the competitor is pursuing before the competitor does, etc.

	TODO: Fixes and Improvements.
	
		*Add a logical stationary tail that the snake could follow. The current
		methodology is faulty due to how the tail mechanic works.
		*Adjust the teleporation thereshold for the top side of the map. The
		teleportation cell intersects the top edge teleportation trigger.
